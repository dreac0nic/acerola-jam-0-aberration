# Acerola Game Jam 0

An entry for the [Acerola Game Jam 0](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0)!

**Under massive construction!**

## Theme -- Abberation

### Jam Reference

> To celebrate the beginning of the new abnormal (this is a strokes
> reference), the theme of Acerola Jam 0 is Aberration.
>
> ab·er·ra·tion
>
> /ˌabəˈrāSH(ə)n/
>
> noun
>
> a departure from what is normal, usual, or expected, typically one
> that is unwelcome.
>
> A literal interpretation of this theme involves the abnormal outcome
> of something measurable, such as chromatic aberration (a defective
> lens causing abnormal refraction), or perhaps an unexpected change
> in the flow of time, a temporal aberration. The abstract
> interpretations of this theme are endless of course and I don't
> think it's possible to take it too far. You could also capture the
> sinister undertones of this word's definition as a certain piece of
> media I like describes supernatural beings as aberrations (unwelcome
> entities you wouldn't expect to exist). This theme is all about
> defying expectations literally and abstractly, as well as getting
> really pretentious.
>
> Side note: If your idea is chromatic aberration, you probably aren't
> going to win unless you're insanely goated.

### Ideas ?

- We not goated
- Typical subversion of motiffs?
- Creature-based abberation?
- Abberation of theme?
- Any game an abberation since the ultimate abberation would be
  abberation of the theme?
